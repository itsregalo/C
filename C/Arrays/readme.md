Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type

 An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.        

Declaration
type arrayName [ arraySize ];

Initialization
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
